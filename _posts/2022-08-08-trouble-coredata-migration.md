## Overview

For iOS devices upgraded from v7.x to v8.x, the previous v7.x tags/attributes are being held on the device and not sent to the server. If an application does not reset or re-generate tags/attributes, the device will send empty tags and attributes to the system.

The applications that have been affected are those that have migrated from v7.x to v8.x of the SDK.

## Data Merge Guide

The following guide will walk through the requirements for merging data sets successfully.

The process of "merging" is a unification of the two data sets. A merging tool has been provided with the SDK to facilitate this process.

Any application that has migrated from v7.x to v8.x (e.g. v8.0.0 - v8.0.6) of the SDK has been affected.

### Steps

1. Upgrade the SDK to the latest version (v8.0.7)
2. Decide on opting in
3. Merge Data

### Upgrade SDK 

Using SPM, upgrade to the latest version of MarketingCloudSDK (v8.0.7) and SFMCSDK (v1.0.5).

### Deciding On Opting In

In some scenarios, an application developer may choose to defer or avoid merging the data sets.

The merging tool allows you to opt-out of the merge process. By not implementing the below steps, the merge tool defaults to an "opted-out" state.

### Opting To Merge

The merging tool offers two options for merging data such as ContactKey, DeviceToken, Attributes, and Tags.

#### Option 1: Automatic Merging

The automatic merging option attempts to merge the old data into the current data set by merging the two, with data within the current data set taking precedence over the data within the v7.x data set.

Below is an illustration of the behavior of the automatic merging tool and how data will be merged:

-------

##### ContactKey

| Prior Data Set | Current Data Set | Merge Result |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| old@example.com | _empty_ | old@example.com |
| _empty_ | current@example.com | current@example.com |
| old@example.com | current@example.com | current@example.com |

-------

##### DeviceToken


| Prior Data Set | Current Data Set | Merge Result |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| device_token_1 | _empty_ | device_token_1 |
| _empty_ | device_token_2 | device_token_2 |
| device_token_1 | device_token_2 | device_token_2 |

-------

##### Attributes

_Note: For this example we denote Key:Value pairs by denoting ":" as the separator_

| Prior Data Set | Current Data Set | Merge Result |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| A:B | _empty_ | A:B |
| _empty_ | A:B | A:B |
| A:B, C:D | A:E | A:E, C:D |
| A:B | A:_cleared_ | A:_cleared_|

-------

##### Tags

| Prior Data Set | Current Data Set | Merge Result |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| SHIRTS | _empty_ | SHIRTS |
| _empty_ | PANTS | PANTS |
| SHIRTS | PANTS | SHIRTS, PANTS |
| SHIRTS | SHIRTS, PANTS | SHIRTS, PANTS |

##### Code Example

_Note: It's recommended to place the following code prior to the initialization of the SDK_

{% include tabbed_gists.html sectionId="automatic_merging_optin" names="Swift,Obj-C" gists="https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/45eff5f9d313ea752b12a7a74acd7667.js,https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/b462cec6e9a2b66dbcf64d75a0406839.js" %}

#### Option 2: Manual Merging

The manual merge option allows the application developer to receive both the prior data and the current data in a callback, giving the developer the opportunity to choose what data will ultimately end up in the data set.


##### Code Example

_Note: It's recommended to place the following code prior to the initialization of the SDK_

{% include tabbed_gists.html sectionId="manual_merging_optin" names="Swift,Obj-C" gists="https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/ecddccc7199ce27df08996014a7b623e.js,https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/8dfce5a8b9d6686eeae8c2c290cd4db8.js" %}

### Retrying

In the event the developer needs to run the merge tool again, there is the option to attempt the merge additional times.

However, **this does not rollback the current data set.** It allows the developer to regain access to the data within the old v7.x data set.

##### Code Example

{% include tabbed_gists.html sectionId="reset_merging" names="Swift,Obj-C" gists="https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/8e8370884b1cf5ce2cd93ed27119d4ee.js,https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/aa4c4f0108ad003cf4a97e0c57365ed8.js" %}
