* **Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements** -- This release includes bug fixes and SDK improvements.
* Adds registration callbacks -- Ability to pass a single callback to listen to registration events.
* Adds configurable filesystem protection types -- Ability to configure the SDKâ€™s [protection values](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/fileprotectiontype). See [Learning App](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/MarketingCloudSDK-iOS/tree/spm/examples/LearningApp/LearningApp) for an example.
* Fixes crashes due to Xcode archive overriding default CFBundleShortVersionString within framework.
* Addresses crashes caused by back-to-back initialization of the SDK.
* Deprecates tearDown methods -- tear downs will be handled internally by the SDK moving forward.
